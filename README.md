# Predicting-Survival-of-Titanic-Passenegers
This project utilizes R for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, followed by Python for predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset, aiming to analyze passenger demographics and predict survival outcomes with high accuracy.
## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize R to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize key insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and transform categorical variables into numerical format.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a Random Forest classifier in Python to predict survival outcomes based on passenger features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly transfer preprocessed data from R to Python for model building and evaluation.
## Results
- EDA reveals insights into passenger demographics, including age distributions and survival rates across different ticket classes.
- Predictive model achieves an accuracy of approximately 84.62%, with detailed evaluation metrics provided.
- Efficient workflow between R and Python enables comprehensive analysis of large datasets.
## Dependencies
- R libraries: dplyr, ggplot2
- Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
